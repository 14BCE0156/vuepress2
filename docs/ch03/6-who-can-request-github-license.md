# Who can request a GitHub license

Below is the provisioning table from APS (Application Policy Services). The far left column is the Ford Employment Type that are allowed to request a license.  The "Self-Request" column indicates if a license can be requested by the individual using the APS system.  

If the **"Self-Request"** field does not contain an "X" than the request for a license must be performed by the Employment Type in the *"Surrogate Requesters"* field. The **"Surrogates must be MR Role"** field indicates that the surrogate must have the MR Role flag set to "Y" (LL6+) to request a license.
