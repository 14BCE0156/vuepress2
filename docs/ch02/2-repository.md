# Repository

All the files of your project are maintained in a repository, together with a history of all file changes. Within the repository, you can manage and discuss the work about your project. You can either individually own repositories or collaboratively own repositories with other organization members. It allows remote collaboration on projects between you and other individuals.

## Repository Visibility

By specifying the visibility of a repository, you can restrict who can access it:
 *public or private or internal*

* **Public** repositories are accessible to everyone on the internet.
* **Private** repositories are only accessible to you, people you specifically provide access to as well as specific organization members in the case of repository access.
* **Internal** repositories are accessible to Ford Motor Company enterprise members.
