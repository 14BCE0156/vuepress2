<ins>**GitHub offers two different categories of Enterprise services:**</ins>

* GitHub Enterprise Server
* GitHub Enterprise Cloud

The primary distinction between the two offerings is that GitHub Enterprise Server is self-hosted, while GitHub Enterprise Cloud is hosted by GitHub.

## GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)

A self-hosted platform for software development within Ford is GitHub Enterprise Server. Utilizing Git version control, robust APIs, productivity and collaboration tools, and integrations, your team can build and release software using GitHub Enterprise Server. Joining and contributing is simple for developers who are already familiar with Ford GitHub's features and workflows.

<ins>**Regarding updates and releases**</ins>

New features and bug fixes are often added to GitHub Enterprise Server through feature and patch releases. Upgrades to your instance are the responsibility of the Ford GitHub admins.

<ins>**Relating to administration**</ins>

Only Ford GitHub admins have administrative access to GitHub Enterprise Server. So they can configure the instance to fit developer needs, set up external authentication and monitor instance activity and performance. Administrators can set up policies that regulate how users interact with your GitHub Enterprise Server instance to make sure that users follow any applicable business rules or legal constraints.

## GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC)

A feature of GitHub Enterprise Cloud called Enterprise Managed Users gives organizations even more control over their employees and resources. Instead of requiring users to create their own GitHub accounts, Enterprise Managed Users provision and manage all users through your Ford identity provider (IdP). Groups on your IdP can be used to manage team membership. Managed user accounts are limited to their enterprise and are not permitted to collaborate, submit code, or communicate with users, repositories, or businesses that are not part of their enterprise.

There are two types of accounts you can use with GitHub Enterprise Cloud:

* A single organization account
* An enterprise account that contains multiple organizations

<ins>**The differences between an organization account and enterprise account**</ins>

With GitHub Enterprise Cloud, organizationÂ and enterprise accounts are both accessible. An organization is a shared account where users may work together on numerous projects at once and where owners and administrators can control who has access to what information and which projects. The management of policy, billing, and security for many enterprises can be done centrally through the use of an enterprise account.

If you select an enterprise account, bear in mind that while some policies can be implemented across all organizations in an enterprise, others can only be specified at the organizational level.
