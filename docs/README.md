::: tip Need Support
Search in this manual if you have an issue and need help.
- If you don't find your solution in the Guide, submit an [IT Connect Request](./ch04/6-how-to-submit-github-request.md) ticket.
- If GitHub is down, submit an [IT Connect Incident](/ch08/10-it-connect-incident-ticket-sde.html) ticket.
- If weekend support is required, log an [IT Connect Request](./ch04/6-how-to-submit-github-request.md) ticket at least 1-week in advance, so SDE team can be made aware of the situation.  The ticket should include details regarding the request and any mitigation steps you are prepared to perform***.
- In event, weekend support is required, please open an INCIDENT ticket at the moment of the incident.   SDE team will respond as soon as possible***.
- Should escalation be needed, please contact SDE supervisor for support.
- FORD GitHub team is a very small team and cannot support 24/7 coverage***.

::: warning Question about GitHub
This user guide would be helpful in understanding and resolving queries on FORD GitHub Enterprise. If you still don't find anything, please contact a member of the GitHub team.

::: danger Application Not Available
If your Jenkins URL returns nothing, meaning Jenkins was not successful in starting up, then you could try to see the container log in [OpenShift Web Console](/ch04/7-deploy-to-openshift.html#openshift-console.html). If you find 'PVC is mounted in another node' or something along the line that would indicate an issue with storage (PVC). Again, please lodge an [IT Connect Incident](/ch08/7-it-connect-incident.html) ticket.
