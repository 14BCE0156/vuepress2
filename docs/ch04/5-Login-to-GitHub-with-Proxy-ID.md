# Login to GitHub with Proxy ID

::: tip NOTE: In order to add a CDSID to a GitHub repository (in a Team or as a Collaborator), the CDSID must successfully log into GitHub once.  This will instantiate the CDSID and make it available in GitHub.
:::

To login to GitHub with your proxy id you will most likely need to use Firefox (TM 7010236) or a MacBook. 
Both options above (Firefox & MacBook) can avoid using your cached/stored credentials to authenticate with GitHub.

### For Firefox follow these steps:
* Open Firefox
* Click the 3 line hamburger icon in the top right corner of the browser. Then select **"New Private Window"**
* Type **"github.ford.com"** in the address bar.
* Click **"Secure Web Logon"** from the ADFS webpage. If only two options, Click Active Directory.
* In the window that pops up enter the proxy id credentials.
