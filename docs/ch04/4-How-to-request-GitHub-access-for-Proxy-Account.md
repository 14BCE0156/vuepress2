# Requesting GitHub access for Proxy Account

### Create a Generic CDSID to use with GitHub
If you do not have a generic ID, please go to [IT Connect](https://ford-dwp.onbmc.com/dwp/app/#/knowledge/KBA00509613/rkm) and follow the instructions to get a generic ID created.
The instructions are for the new EIdm process (this process replaced SILAS).

After a proxy CDSID is created (there is a CDS record)...
The workflow to create an APS request for a proxy account is located on the following website- [Access Management](https://www.accessmgmt.ford.com/CspsWeb/cspsHomeBegin.do)

To request a proxy account (CDSIDs with Employment Types: E, G, & O) from the above website, an LL6+ must submit the APS request.

All CDSIDs must have a "NT Domain" (i.e. FORDNA1) defined in the CDS record.
These Employment Types (E, G, & O) are typically used for proxy ids.

### How to request access
* In the **"Request Access"** section, select the **"change"** button. Type in the proxy account and click the **"Go"** button.

* In the textbox next to **"All Application Domain"** type **'GitHub'**, then click the **"Search"** button.

* In the **"Applications"** section, request access.

::: tip Note: Only an LL6+ can request access to GitHub for a "generic id".
